<p>Spanish food is as diverse and rich as the country itself, with high-quality ingredients, superb cuisine, and a wise long heritage. It is easy to define Spain in terms of cuisine. Consumes olives, extra virgin olive oil, fresh vegetables, garlic, poultry, fish, seafood, Iberian jerky, and good wines while distilling the essence of the primary culinary components of Spain. But these are just a few of the many reasons why food is one of the most popular reasons to visit Spain. The main reason is that Spanish food is quite diversified, ranging from the well-known tapas to the greatest local and regional specialties found elsewhere in the world.
