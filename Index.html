    <p>The thing that makes this city so magical is the ease to travel around it. Public transportation is the key to this. A single journey on any kind of public transportation in Madrid starts at €1.50. The flat rate for bus tickets, but multi-zone single journeys can cost up to €2 on the metro and €5.50 on the commuter train (cercanías). Only use Cercanias for longer distances and tedious transfers among trains. All transportation methods have an additional charge for going to and from the airport. In case that you are relying a lot on public transport, consider a 10-trip ticket pack. This card costs €3 and the 10-trip ticket pack €12.20, which allows it to be shared among family or friends. Also, you can recharge as many times as you want!</p>
